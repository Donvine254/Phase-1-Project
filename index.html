    <article>Why The Chicken Crossed The Road

      We all know the story of how the chicken crossed the road. But is that what really happened? Well according to scientists chickens don’t have much brains, they aren’t very smart and crossing the road would be a little too far fetched.
      
      The story goes, Why did the chicken cross the road? To answer your question, he didn’t cross the road. Simply he just couldn’t cross it. Maybe he was scared or maybe he chicken out (see what I did there). Yep that’s what happened he was too scared. Like the story of Moses parting the sea, the chicken crossing road tale has been embellished over the generations.
      
      
      My dad designs roads, calling one of his masterpieces the Morley Pretzel. The road was closed because they had just but down some asphalt. There was an magnificent park just across the road and this particular chicken was DESPERATE to fly his way to heaven. He bolted across the road, with the wind in his comb and the image of him swimming gleefully on the swing set floating in his miniature pea sized brain. What could possibly go wrong? As the council truck moved its way down the road squirting black sludge onto the surface this dangerous chicken set his first talon out into the unknown.
      
      One talon, then the next, out in the open. Beep! Beep! The monstrous truck inched closer and closer to the chicken. Stuck. He couldn’t move. He leaned left and right, he tried to jump and run, but nothing worked. It was too late. Rest In peace good friend.
      
      Two brave little talons now stood in the ground, a famous landmark. People from all around the world came to see this particular chicken or it’s crispy remains. Search up tripadvisor.com.au, the stuck chicken, book a tour perhaps. People pay hundreds to see his flame grilled legs. Even famous celebrities came to get a closer look, Simon Cowell even called it alright!
      
      While the bottom half of his body was getting all the fame and glory, his top half wasn’t having much fun. This chicken had gone through a lot, his feet had become stuck, his dream of going to playground heaven had been crushed. Luckily his chicken torso was salvageable, adopted by a school tuck shop.
      
      Scrumptious chicken wraps, burgers and nuggets were made with love, fresh from the depths of the oven. You could say it was worth it, but we’ll never forget the day the chicken crossed the road. Hundreds of kids ate the legendary food on Fridays and Wednesdays. Tender chicken cooked to perfection.
      
      So the next time you order your tuck shop take some time to appreciate the sacrifice of this chicken and the rough times he had experienced. So that’s how the chicken didn’t cross the road. Sorry dad.
